<h3>
    "Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of,
    and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free
    alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all
    products derived wholly or partly from animals."

    What is Veganism?

    Contrary to popular belief, veganism is not a diet.
    Veganism is a philosophy based around the goal of reducing the suffering and exploitation of animals as much as possible.
    This is a very nebulous statement, so the purpose of this website is to help people understand what this means in practice,
    and to provide a focused, academic perspective on veganism.

    The Plant Based Diet

    A plant based diet is one which mostly or entirely relies on plants for nutrition.
    People may adopt such a diet for a variety of reasons, including religious, health, econological, or ethical concerns.
    Several popular "plant-based diets" include vegetarians and vegans.

    The misconception that veganism is a diet arises from the fact that the most common manifestation of vegan philosophy is dietary restriction.
